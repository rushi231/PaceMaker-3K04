## DCM

To run the file for the DCM make sure to have PYQT5 installed and install any libraries (this can be seen at the top of the main file). 
If there are any path errors just run the main file only instead of opening the whole folder at once. 

## My Process
Built With 
  - Python
  -PyQt5
  - Simulink
 
 ## What I learned
  - This was my first time using serial commuincation with python on such a big project. I learned how to send in values to a paceamaker and verify if they correct data is being inputted and outputted. It took time to figure out how to get it working as there were many challenges we had to overcome. 
  
   ```
 
  ```
  
 ## Continued Development
  - With the short amount of time I would implement a feature where any numbers can be sent to the pacemaker instead of just hard coded values each time. Also this would lead to a better egram graph. This will be done in the future.
